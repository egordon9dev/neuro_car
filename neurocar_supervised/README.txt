To Run:

unzip camera_ranges_action.zip into the data folder
i.e. the .td files go in data/camera_ranges_action




How to Use the Data:

load_data.py forms the main interface with the data.
the user should not have to deal with the raw .td
files.

each data frame is a NeuroCarDataFrame containing
an image, action, and ranges
